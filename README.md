# ‚ö° PowerShell: Bulk User Creation

## üìå Overview
This lab explored how to automate user creation within Active Directory using PowerShell. I used a script to generate multiple users, assign them to an Organizational Unit, and confirm their creation by logging into the domain from a client machine.

## üß∞ Skills & Tools
- PowerShell Scripting  
- Active Directory Automation  
- Organizational Unit (OU) Management  
- Script Execution via PowerShell ISE  

## ‚úÖ What Was Done
- Logged into the DC-1 virtual machine as `jane_admin`
- Opened PowerShell ISE with administrator privileges
- Downloaded and executed a PowerShell script to bulk-create users with unique usernames and passwords
- Verified user creation inside the `_EMPLOYEES` OU within Active Directory Users and Computers
- Successfully logged into Client-1 with one of the newly created accounts to confirm authentication

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- PowerShell ISE  
- AD Module for PowerShell  
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)  

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots  
*(Insert screenshots showing the script, PowerShell ISE, execution results, and user entries in ADUC)*

## üìò Lessons Learned
- PowerShell scripting can greatly streamline repetitive administrative tasks  
- Automation ensures consistency and efficiency when creating multiple user accounts  
- Proper script testing and validation is critical before executing changes in production environments
